## What is this

TransTerm is an highly experimental text based graphical user interface to act on YouTube videos.

Being text based, this program runs even in the terminal.

## Features

- Download any youtube video at the highest resolution by default in mp4 format
- Is able to automatically convert the downloaded video both in mp3 or wav format
- Playlist support for the above features including automatically rename the files using the video title and the channel name
- Transcribe a ssingle downloaded video using either:
  • Google Audio to Text
  • Google Audio to Text + Silence detection
  • Sphynx CMU (processed offline locally)

## Installation for Mac & Linux

      git clone https://github.com/thecookingsenpai/transterm && cd transterm

      sudo chmod +x install.sh

      ./install.sh

## Troubleshooting

In some cases, where python3 environment is managed by the system and not by pip3, it is advisable to install the dependencies manually as you would do with your system. If you want to force the installation anyway, first run:

      pip3 install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages

The same general solution applies to any requirements problem. PLease note that using the above command is not recommended as it could break your python installation.

## Installation for Window

      git clone https://github.com/thecookingsenpai/transterm && cd transterm && pip3 install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

      python3 gui.py

## Manual mode (aka debug)

You can edit the bottom part of term.py so that after the

      if __name__ == "__main__":

condition you can write your own logic. Then, launch with:

      python3 term.py

For convenience, a playlist example is already included (with the best playlist ever, I'd say).
